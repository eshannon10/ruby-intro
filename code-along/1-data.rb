# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers

puts 2
puts 5
puts (2 + 5) * 5

# Non-numbers

puts "hello, world"

puts "tacos " * 3

# True, False

# Nothing

# Variables
food = "tacos"
quantity = 3

# Combine strings and variables

puts "tacos: #{quantity}"

# String manipulation
puts "Hello".length
puts "how are you".capitalize
puts "how are you".upcase
puts "Hi".swapcase
puts "EREHWON".reverse
